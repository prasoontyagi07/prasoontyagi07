  <p>"Delicate" is an electropop song by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift (pictured), taken from her sixth studio album, Reputation (2017), and released as a single in March 2018. It was written by Swift and its producers, Max Martin and Shellback. The lyrics are about insecurity with a new love interest. To create a sound accompanying the vulnerable sentiment, Martin and Shellback manipulated Swift's vocals with a vocoder. "Delicate" is a ballad with dense synthesizers and house beats. In the music video, Swift dances barefoot through public places, dripping wet from the rain and invisible to others. Music critics praised Swift's songwriting and the mellower production compared to the album's overarching brash sound. The song featured in 2018 year-end lists by Billboard, Slant Magazine, and Rolling Stone. A sleeper hit in the U.S., "Delicate" peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped Billboard's airplay charts: Mainstream Top 40, Adult Contemporary, and Adult Pop Songs. (Full article...)
